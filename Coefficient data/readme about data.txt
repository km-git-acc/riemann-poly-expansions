This section contains all the pre-computed coefficients for the expansions in orthogonal polynomials. The polynomial name is the first part of the file name. The specific parameters used in the pre-computation follow a simple code: a12 = a =1/2, c34 = c =3/4. When a decimal point is required we use a d to indicate it: N200d3 = N = 200.3.

The suffix "int" means the run was done for the function 2/x*sin(2/x) instead of the Riemann Xi-function. 

This folder also includes a file containing the first few zeros of the Riemann Xi(t) function.
